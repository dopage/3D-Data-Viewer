## About

The goal of this project is to allow the visualization of data from an external API in a 3D representation on the surface of the earth. The API used is a public database called OBIS which contains the list of all the reports of marine species for several years. We have created a graphical interface to search, select, compare, filter and learn about these species.

## Technologies & Dependencies

- Java (JRE11) : Programming language used.
- JavaFX (v16) : A framework to create a graphical interface for desktop applications.
- ControlsFX : ControlsFX is a library of UI controls and useful API.
- ObjModelImporterJFX.jar : Enable JavaFX applications to access 3D models and scenes provided in files based on widely supported 3D formats.
- JSON-20210307.jar : To read JSON file.

## Features & Explanations

<p align = center>
 The graphical interface is composed of 2 big parts: on one side a world-map and on the other side everything that can interact with it.</br></br>

</p>

 The first feature is to search for records of a species by entering its name. 
 It is possible to restrict this search by adding a period to the search.
 Finally by modifying the geoHash, the precision of the search will be different.</br></br>

 Auto-completion is available to facilitate the user's search.</br></br>

 The result of this search is displayed on the world map with a caption.</br></br>

</p>

<p align = center>
 The second feature is the ability to interact directly with the world map.</br>
 By using `ALT + CLICK` on it, the program will display all the species that have already been reported in the click area.</br>
 The click is more or less accurate depending on the geoHash value.</br>
 By interacting with the list it is possible to get more information about a species.</br>
 Finally, by double clicking on a species in the list, a search is initiated.</br></br>

</p>

<p align = center>
 The last feature is the Histogram mode. It allows you to see the result of a search in a different way.</br>
 Other buttons are available to control the world map and an animation of the data is possible if the search is bounded by dates.</br> </br>
